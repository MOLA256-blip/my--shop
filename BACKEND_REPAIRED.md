# Backend Repaired - Flutterwave Redirect Fix

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Settings.py Syntax Error**
- **Fixed:** Line 239 had `REACT_=BASE_URL` ‚Üí Changed to `REACT_BASE_URL`
- **Added:** `FRONTEND_URL` variable for consistency with frontend expectations

### 2. **Redirect URL Configuration**
- **Updated:** Payment initiation now uses `FRONTEND_URL` consistently
- **Added:** Debug logging to track redirect URL being sent to Flutterwave

### 3. **Debug Logging Added**
- **Payment Initiation:** Shows cart code, amount, redirect URL, and transaction ID
- **Payment Callback:** Shows status, transaction reference, and verification results
- **Error Tracking:** Better error messages and logging

## üîß Changes Made

### File: `shopp_it/settings.py`

**Lines 230-240:**
```python
# Payment Gateway Settings
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY', '')
FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
FRONTEND_BASE_URL = os.getenv('FRONTEND_BASE_URL', 'http://localhost:5173')
FRONTEND_URL = os.getenv('FRONTEND_URL', 'http://localhost:5173')  # ‚Üê ADDED

PAYPAL_MODE = os.getenv('PAYPAL_MODE', 'sandbox')
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = os.getenv('PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID', '')
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv('PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET', '')

REACT_BASE_URL = os.getenv("REACT_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:5173")  # ‚Üê FIXED
```

### File: `core/views.py`

**Lines 83-120 (Payment Initiation):**
```python
# Prepare Flutterwave payload
redirect_url = f"{settings.FRONTEND_URL}/payment/status"  # ‚Üê UPDATED

payload = {
    'tx_ref': tx_ref,
    'amount': str(grand_total),
    'currency': 'USD',
    'redirect_url': redirect_url,  # ‚Üê USES NEW VARIABLE
    'customer': {
        'email': request.user.email or f"{request.user.username}@example.com",
        'name': request.user.get_full_name() or request.user.username,
    },
    'customizations': {
        'title': 'Shop Payment',
        'description': f'Payment for cart {cart_code}',
    }
}

# Debug logging - ADDED
print(f"üîç Flutterwave Payment Initiation:")
print(f"   - Cart Code: {cart_code}")
print(f"   - Amount: ${grand_total}")
print(f"   - Redirect URL: {redirect_url}")
print(f"   - Transaction ID: {tx_ref}")
```

**Lines 224-233 (Callback Logging):**
```python
# Debug logging - ADDED
print(f"üîç Flutterwave Callback Received:")
print(f"   - Status: {status_param}")
print(f"   - TX Ref: {tx_ref}")
print(f"   - Transaction ID: {transaction_id}")

if not all([status_param, tx_ref, transaction_id]):
    print(f"   ‚ùå Missing parameters!")
    return Response({'success': False, 'message': 'Missing parameters'}, 
                  status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

## üöÄ How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server

**CRITICAL:** You must restart the server for changes to take effect!

```bash
cd c:\Users\junior\Desktop\shopp_it
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 2: Watch Console Output

When you initiate a payment, you should see:
```
üîç Flutterwave Payment Initiation:
   - Cart Code: abc123
   - Amount: $105.50
   - Redirect URL: http://localhost:5173/payment/status
   - Transaction ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
   - Flutterwave Response Status: 200
```

### Step 3: Test Payment Flow

1. **Start frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\junior\Desktop\---shoppit_app
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test payment:**
   - Add items to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Click "Pay with Flutterwave"
   - Use test card:
     - Card: `5531 8866 5214 2950`
     - CVV: `564`
     - Expiry: `09/32`
     - PIN: `3310`
     - OTP: `12345`

3. **After payment:**
   - Should redirect to: `http://localhost:5173/payment/status?status=successful&...`
   - Backend console should show callback:
     ```
     üîç Flutterwave Callback Received:
        - Status: successful
        - TX Ref: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
        - Transaction ID: 1234567
     ‚úÖ Payment verified successfully! Order ID: 1
     ```

## üìã Verification Checklist

After restarting the backend, verify:

- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] No syntax errors in console
- [ ] `.env` file has `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173`
- [ ] Payment initiation shows debug output
- [ ] Redirect URL is correct in console: `http://localhost:5173/payment/status`
- [ ] After payment, Flutterwave redirects back to your site
- [ ] Callback receives and processes payment data
- [ ] Order is created successfully
- [ ] Cart is cleared after successful payment

---

## üêõ Debugging

### Check Backend Console

When testing, keep an eye on the Django console. You should see:

1. **When clicking "Pay with Flutterwave":**
   ```
   üîç Flutterwave Payment Initiation:
      - Cart Code: ...
      - Amount: $...
      - Redirect URL: http://localhost:5173/payment/status
      - Transaction ID: ...
      - Flutterwave Response Status: 200
   ```

2. **After completing payment on Flutterwave:**
   ```
   üîç Flutterwave Callback Received:
      - Status: successful
      - TX Ref: ...
      - Transaction ID: ...
   ‚úÖ Payment verified successfully! Order ID: ...
   ```

### Common Issues

**Issue: "FRONTEND_URL not found"**
- Solution: Restart Django server after adding to settings.py

**Issue: "Redirect URL still wrong"**
- Solution: Check `.env` file has correct URL
- Restart server after changing `.env`

**Issue: "No debug output in console"**
- Solution: Make sure you're looking at Django console, not frontend
- Verify changes were saved in `views.py`

## üéØ What Should Work Now

1. ‚úÖ Payment initiation creates correct redirect URL
2. ‚úÖ Flutterwave receives proper redirect URL
3. ‚úÖ After payment, user is redirected back to your site
4. ‚úÖ Frontend receives payment status parameters
5. ‚úÖ Backend callback verifies payment
6. ‚úÖ Order is created and cart is cleared
7. ‚úÖ Debug logs help track the entire flow

---

## üìù Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should have:

```env
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Flutterwave Payment Gateway
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK_TEST-5e986a546df456ebba3e8121e1b446f5-X
FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWPUBK_TEST-8abcdf6bba4ab236380f77d70ed88e5f-X
```

---

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Always restart Django server** after changing `.env` or `settings.py`
2. **Check console output** to verify redirect URL is correct
3. **Test in incognito mode** to avoid cache issues
4. **Keep both frontend and backend running** during testing
5. **Use test mode API keys** - never test with live keys

---

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If redirect still doesn't work:

1. **Check Django console** - Look for the debug output
2. **Verify redirect URL** - Should be `http://localhost:5173/payment/status`
3. **Check Flutterwave dashboard** - View transaction details
4. **Test manually** - Visit the redirect URL with test parameters
5. **Check browser console** - Look for JavaScript errors

---

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

1. ‚úÖ Django console shows correct redirect URL
2. ‚úÖ After payment, browser redirects to your site
3. ‚úÖ Payment status page loads with success message
4. ‚úÖ Order appears in database
5. ‚úÖ Cart is cleared
6. ‚úÖ No errors in console

**Repaired:** Oct 25, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for testing  
**Next Step:** Restart backend and test payment flow
