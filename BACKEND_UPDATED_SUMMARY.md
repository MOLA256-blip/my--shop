## 📱 Next Step: Update YOUR Phone Numbers

**File:** `c:\Users\junior\Desktop\---shoppit_app\src\components\checkout\PaymentSection.jsx`

**Line 106** - Change to YOUR actual numbers:

```javascript
<li>Send <strong>₦{Number(totalAmount).toLocaleString()}</strong> to: <strong>{selectedProvider === 'mtn' ? '0803-YOUR-MTN' : '0802-YOUR-AIRTEL'}</strong></li>
```

**Example:**
```javascript
<li>Send <strong>₦{Number(totalAmount).toLocaleString()}</strong> to: <strong>{selectedProvider === 'mtn' ? '0803-555-1234' : '0802-666-7890'}</strong></li>

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

### Always Verify:
1. Check your mobile money account
2. Confirm transaction ID exists
3. Verify amount matches
4. Check phone number is reasonable
5. Only then click "Verify"

### Prevent Fraud:
- Transaction IDs are unique (can't be reused)
- All payments logged with user info
- Admin can add notes
- Can reject suspicious payments
